# project.properties file defines overrides for default.properties

# Explanation: This file should be created by each user as and when he or she needs to override particular values.
# Consequently, it should not be placed under version control.

# App Engine and Tipfy build settings:
#
# uncomment lines to override defaults

# enter your email address if you don't want to be prompted every time
# admin.email       = 

# if you want to deploy the compiled build to a particular app or version
# app.name          = my-app
# app.ver           = 1

# if you want the development version to be uploaded to a different app or version
# dev-app.name      = my-app-dev
# dev-app.ver       = dev

gae-lib.dir       = /usr/local/google_appengine


# Stylesheets
#
# Note: Stylesheets will be concatenated in the order they are listed in the file.stylesheets property (i.e. the last
# file listed will be at the end of the concatenated file), so it probably makes sense to have the main style.css file
# as the first entry
# Example:
# file.stylesheets  = style.css, lightbox.css, plugin.css
#
file.stylesheets  =


# Web Pages
#
# These are the pages (files) that will be served to users (.html, .php, .asp, etc). Files in this property will
# be minified / optimised and have any stylesheet or javascript references updated to the minified examples
#
# The paths need to be relative
#
# Files can be added in a comma separated form
file.pages        = **/templates/h5bp.html



# Excluded files and dirs
#
# Add any files or directories you add to the project and do not want to be copied to the publish directory as a
# comma separated list
# These files are ignored in addition to the default ones specified in default.properties.
file.exclude      = **/*.pyc


# Specify an environment to build
#
# By Default, it builds a production environment
# Set to dev if building a development environment
# Set to test if building a test environment

# Directory Structure
#
# Override any directory paths specific to this project
#

# dir.js.libs
