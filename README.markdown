# CogniStats
### quantified mind

If you could measure how your mental performance varies day-to-day and year-to-year, what would you do with those numbers? Would you try to make yourself smarter? Improve your focus and energy? Fight cognitive decline? Understand your mental health?

With CogniStats, we're making a tool that will quickly, reliably, and comprehensively measure your basic cognitive abilities. It's a battery of tests designed to give you the best measurement in the least time. We've studied neuropsychological tests used in academia and by psychologists, and we've adapted the core components in a practical web application that you can use whenever, wherever, and as often as you want in order to understand your brain.

We are interested in scientifically testing ways of improving cognition and quantifying the effects of interventions on our cognitive processes. If something will make you smarter (not someone, not everyone, but you), then you want to know! Eat butter and vitamin D, sleep enough, avoid sugar, work out, take piracetam--who can say? You need to try things and measure the results. With enough data, effects will become clear. But the measurement is not an easy problem.

Human cognition is complex and multidimensional (working memory, reaction times, motor function, executive function, etc.). We want a tool that can measure all of that. Currently, many neuropsychological tests exist, but they are not suitable for this project for three reasons:
1. Many were designed to identify pathologies rather than quantify performance in healthy adults.
2. They're too long or not effective enough. They measure some constructs of interest, but not in the most efficient way.
3. They're not repeatable. The tests are fixed and can only be given once, or need to be done by a psychologist.

We want tests which are:
1. Effective, so they measure directly the skills that interest us.
2. Short, so they can be done many times without wasting time.
3. Repeatable, so we can do them again and again before and after interventions.
4. Computer-deliverable, so no human proctor needs to be involved. It's even better if they can be done on a smartphone.

[CogniStats](http://cognistats.appspot.com/) (not at all ready for use) is a web app collection of these tests, which cover as many important cognitive skills as we can reasonably measure. We deal with practice effects by designing tests that most directly test the skill itself, so that you quickly reach your upper limit, meaning that further variation is likely due to interventions, not just getting better at the tests.

You can take tests depending on your free time and energy levels, so you don't have to do them all in every session. We'll give you score reports and help you interpret your numbers. You'll decide what you want to do with it, whether you want to run experiments, establish a baseline to help detect decline or disease, or are just curious. CogniStats just measures; it doesn't manage experiments.

## Current Status

We've done over a year of research to identify over 20 gold-standard academic tests currently in use. We've implemented them all in an offline prototype. Now we're working on converting them to HTML5 and JavaScript, building a web app around them, and gathering interest. We need a lot of volunteers to take a lot of tests before we can start doing the math to cull out the redundant bits, so please sign up to be notified when it's ready for testing later this summer. If you want to help build it, that's great, too! Just send a message to [yonidonner on GitHub](http://github.com/yonidonner).

(As the project is too early for testing, we haven't set up the Google Group for testers to join yet--please check back soon!)
